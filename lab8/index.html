                        <h2>Challenge</h2>
                        <p>The challenge of this lab was to explore anonymous functions and callback functions using JavaScript.
                            I used the map() method to apply both named and anonymous functions to an array,
                            and experimented with how results are returned and logged to the console.
                        </p>
                </div>
                <div class="minor-section">
                        <h2>Problems</h2>
                        <p>One small issue I ran into at first was a ReferenceError caused by using an undefined variable name.
                            Initially, in the console I had used array.map() when I named my variable numbers instead.
                            After realizing the mismatch, I corrected the variable name and the error was resolved.
                            Testing everything in the console first helped me debug before adding the code to the JS file.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Reflection</h2>
                        <p>This lab was a good refresher on how callbacks and anonymous functions work in JavaScript.
                            It was satisfying to see how the map() method transformed the array using different functions.
                            As I kept going, the logic was clear and the syntax was starting to feel more intuitive.
                            I also practiced consistent debugging and organizing of my code clearly, which made the process smoother.
