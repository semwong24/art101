			<h1>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables</h1>
			<p> Working with your partner, experiment with basic JavaScript data types and variables.</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to declare and use different JavaScript variables, and output their values using document.writeln() to display them on a webpage.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One small issue I ran into was making sure the script was correctly linked to the HTML file and that it executed after the page fully loaded.
						Something that helped resolve this issue was the inclusion of the DEFER attribute in the script tag already in the file, which after some researching 
						means it ensures that the script runs after the HTML has been passed.
						I also double-checked that the file paths matched the folder structure. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment was straightforward and a good refresher on basic JavaScript syntax, especially how to define variables and display them on the page.
						I enjoyed setting up the file structure and seeing my code run in the browser. I put in consistent effort into making the code clean and readable, using good indentation and comments. 
						Overall, this lab was a solid practice in combining HTML, CSS, and JS in a working project. </p>
