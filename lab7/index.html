			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
            <p>Working with your partner, write functions that take user input.</p>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to practice writing and using JavaScript functions, particularly ones that take user input, manipulate strings, and return results.
                        We had to create a function that prompts the user for their name, sorts the letters alphabetically, and displays the sorted result on the webpage.
                    </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Initially, due to the way I set up my index.html file, I noticed the prompt was appearing twice. After checking the HTML, I discovered that the JavaScript file was being linked twice,
                        once in the head and again in the body, which caused the function to run two times. Removing the script tag not in the output section, fixed this issue.
                        Going a bit further, I also realized that clicking "Cancel" or entering a blank input would result in strange behavior, so I added a fallback that gives the user one more chance to enter their name,
                        or else it would show a default message. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was a fun way to explore how functoins work with user input and string manipulation. This lab helped reinforce how important it is to handle edge cases, like empty or canceled input, 
                        and how presentation matters through styling and clear output. Additionally, this lab helped me think about how browser behavior can be affected by multiple script tags.
                        Overall, the process went smoothly, and debugging the issues I found taught me useful problem-solving strategies.
                    </p>
