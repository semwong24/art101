					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a basic local file structure, write and style an HTML file using CSS,
						view it in a browser, and inspect the elements using Chrome's developer tools.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We didn't run into any major issues during this lab. Everything was pretty straightforward.
						The ony small hiccup was making sure the file paths were correct, especially when linking the CSS file.
						We double-checked the folder structure and the link tag to ensure it was correct. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was honestly easy to breeze through. Due to previous coding experience, I felt confident using VSCode and navigating the folder structure.
						It was satisfying to see my styling changes appear in the browser right way. I put in solid focused energy while working, enough to get everything done cleanly without stress. 
						I also appreciated being able to experiment a bit with CSS and div styling.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>In the end, a collaborative effort was made to complete the full HTML and CSS file setup, adding custom styling, and successfully viewng and inspecting the file in the browser.</p>
