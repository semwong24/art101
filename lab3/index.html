			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to create a clean and organized file structure locally on my computer, and add index.html files.
						The goal I would say was to understand how file management and version control work in a real web development workflow.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem I ran into was making sure all the file paths were correct, especially when linking the image and CSS files. 
						I made sure to double check the file path each time I referenced a linked element.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab helped me understand how important it is to stay organized with file structures when working on web projects.
						Once I had the folders set up properly, everything made a lot more sense. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p> The page is now online and styled using both sitewide and lab-specific CSS.
						All links work, and the project has been uploaded to Github, the appropriate screenshots will also be added to the lab.</p>
					<div id="output"></div>
